/*
* Server Bidirectional RPC:

- In a bidirectional streaming RPC, both the client and server send a stream of messages to each other.
- This type of RPC is useful for scenarios where both the client and server need to send and receive data concurrently.
- Bidirectional streaming RPCs are suitable for scenarios such as chat applications or real-time collaboration.
Example: Client and server establish a chat session, and both can send messages to each other in real-time.
